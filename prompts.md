# hecbench renovation 

HecBench is a benchmark suite for heterogeneous computing. each benchmark is contained in a separate subdirectory and it has multiple versions of the benchmark implemented in a different programming models.

Take a staged approach to implementing your recommendations.

save your plan in plan.md

## phase 1

- review hecbench benchmarks and recommend improvements to the suite. 

## phase 2

- update build system to use cmake
- update the build system to use presets
- udpate the build system to allow very targetted building of specific benchmarks and programming models.

## phase 3

- recommend new tools to make the user experience better, given the breadth and complexity of this benchmark suite.
- develop tools manage benchmarking experiments including executing benchmark campaigns and analyzing, visualizing the results

## phase 4

- create a serial cpu implementation of the benchmarks based on the openmp implementation
- recommend new benchmarks for areas not well covered by the existing suite

## phase 5

- any final recommendations on future proofing this suite against extremely heterogeneous architectures we expect in the next five years.
