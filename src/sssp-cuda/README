Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) written in CUDA

Unzip the input data file:
    tar -zxf data.tar.gz

Compilation instructions (e.g. device with compute capability 7.0):

    make ARCH=sm_70

Execution instructions

    make run

For more options:

    ./sssp -h


Note:
The input folder contains two graphs from the 9th DIMACS Implementation Challenge 
(http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml). This benchmark can use 
any input graph, provided that the format is as follows:
(Beginning of the file)
#Nodes #Edges Source_node

A0 B0
A1 B1
...

C0 D0
C1 D1
...

Each tuple (Ai, Bi) represents one node. Each tuple (Cj, Dj) represents one edge.
Thus, the file contains the list of nodes, followed by the list of edges.
Ai indicates the position where the edges of node i start in the list of edges.
Bi means the number of edges of node i.
Cj is the node where edge j terminates (i.e., the head of the edge). Dj is the
cost of edge j.
