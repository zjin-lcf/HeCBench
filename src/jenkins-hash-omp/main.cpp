   mix -- mix 3 32-bit values reversibly.

   This is reversible, so any information in (a,b,c) before mix() is
   still in (a,b,c) after mix().

   If four pairs of (a,b,c) inputs are run through mix(), or through
   mix() in reverse, there are at least 32 bits of the output that
   are sometimes the same for one pair and different for another pair.
   This was tested for:
 * pairs that differed by one bit, by two bits, in any combination
 of top bits of (a,b,c), or in any combination of bottom bits of
 (a,b,c).
 * "differ" is defined as +, -, ^, or ~^.  For + and -, I transformed
 the output delta to a Gray code (a^(a>>1)) so a string of 1's (as
 is commonly produced by subtraction) look like a single 1-bit
 difference.
 * the base values were pseudorandom, all zero but one bit set, or 
 all zero plus a counter that starts at zero.

 Some k values for my "a-=c; a^=rot(c,k); c+=b;" arrangement that
 satisfy this are
 4  6  8 16 19  4
 9 15  3 18 27 15
 14  9  3  7 17  3
 Well, "9 15 3 18 27 15" didn't quite get 32 bits diffing
 for "differ" defined as + with a one-bit base and a two-bit delta.  I
 used http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/avalanche.html to choose 
 the operations, constants, and arrangements of the variables.

 This does not achieve avalanche.  There are input bits of (a,b,c)
 that fail to affect some output bits of (a,b,c), especially of a.  The
 most thoroughly mixed value is c, but it doesn't really even achieve
 avalanche in c.

 This allows some parallelism.  Read-after-writes are good at doubling
 the number of bits affected, so the goal of mixing pulls in the opposite
 direction as the goal of parallelism.  I did what I could.  Rotates
 seem to cost as much as shifts on every machine I could lay my hands
 on, and rotates are much kinder to the top and bottom bits, so I used
 rotates.

   final -- final mixing of 3 32-bit values (a,b,c) into c

   Pairs of (a,b,c) values differing in only a few bits will usually
   produce values of c that look totally different.  This was tested for
 * pairs that differed by one bit, by two bits, in any combination
 of top bits of (a,b,c), or in any combination of bottom bits of
 (a,b,c).
 * "differ" is defined as +, -, ^, or ~^.  For + and -, I transformed
 the output delta to a Gray code (a^(a>>1)) so a string of 1's (as
 is commonly produced by subtraction) look like a single 1-bit
 difference.
 * the base values were pseudorandom, all zero but one bit set, or 
 all zero plus a counter that starts at zero.

 These constants passed:
 14 11 25 16 4 14 24
 12 14 25 16 4 14 24
 and these came close:
 4  8 15 26 3 22 24
 10  8 15 26 3 22 24
 11  8 15 26 3 22 24
