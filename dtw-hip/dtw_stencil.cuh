 * distance matrix for multivariate time series with CUDA.
 * Uses a shared memory stencil for caching the previous diagonal
 * Input D should be a __device__ array.
 * Each threadblock computes DTW for a pair of time series
 * Each thread can process one anti-diagonal.
 *
 * @param D A 3D tensor of pairwise squared Euclidean distance matrices
 * between time series
 * @param R An m+2 x n+2 array that will be filled with the alignments
 * @param cost The total path costs will be written to this array of length nD
 * @param nD The number of distance matrices in D and its leading dimension
 * @param m Length of first time series
 * @param n Length of second time series
 * @param gamma smoothing parameter
