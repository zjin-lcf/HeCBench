This segfault happens in the deconstruction of command group execution graph. In its actual form, the benchmark spawns a long chain of dependent events which need to be deleted on exit. Actually, this deletion occurs in a recursive manner. In our case, this recursion fills the stack memory causing the segfault.

There are two options to avoid this, the first is to set as unlimited the stack size with 
 $ ulimit -s unlimited.

The second is moving buffer d_test definition (line 40) within the outer loop (line 45). This shorts the event chain allowing its deconstruction to fit in the default stack size.
