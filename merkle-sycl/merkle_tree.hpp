// Given N -many leaves of Binary Merkle Tree computes all (N - 1) -many
// intermediate nodes by using Rescue Prime `merge` function, which
// merges two Rescue Prime digests into single of width 256 -bit
//
// N needs to be power of two
//
// Returns sum of all kernel execution times with nanosecond
// level granularity
